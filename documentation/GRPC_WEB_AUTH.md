# Authorizing gRPC-Web requests

Every route except for the login & account creation routes require a valid JWT token to be present in the request header. The token is generated by the server and sent to the client upon successful login. The client must then store the token and send it with every request.

## Preparing your gRPC client

Simply plug `authOptions` into your client's constructor to enable the auth interceptor. The interceptor will automatically add the token to every request.

```js
// Import the auth interceptor
import { authOptions } from '../middleware/AuthInterceptor.js';

// Create a new client with the auth interceptor
const client = new MyServiceClient("http://localhost:8080", null, authOptions);
```
